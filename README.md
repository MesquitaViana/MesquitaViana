  **My name is Gabriel Mesquita, and I work as a software engineer living in Brazil. I am passionate about how open-source code connects the world. In addition to programming, I am passionate about volleyball, paintball, movies, and series.**  
 
 <br>

 **Currently, I'm 18 years old and fully dedicated to back-end development. I started programming in late 2019 when my uncle asked me to create a website for his accounting office, and that's when my programming journey began.**
